# Thesis (one line)
If one gated loop generates both reality and consciousness with the same operators, that loop is a Theory of Everything.

---

## The loop (CLB)
∇ converge → **WI** transduce (whole-in) → ℰ emerge → **WE** transduce (whole-express) → ⇆ diverge → ⧉ interfere → (back to) ∇

**Hard gates at each hop:** Amplitude, SRL, CLB-R.

---

## Why this qualifies as a ToE
- **Isomorphism:** The very same loop maps to physics *(curvature → scattering → radiation → interference)* and to mind *(binding → qualia → action → feedback)*.
- **Correspondence:** **Ω-OFF** recovers GR/QFT/Bayes; nothing breaks where we already know the laws.
- **Extension + Tests:** **Ω-ON** adds lawful gates *(positivity/crossing, band-limited focus, braid checks)* that make new, falsifiable predictions.

## Pseudocode (unifies world & mind)
```python
# Ω-mode governs what can commit:
#   Ω-OFF → correspondence only
#   Ω-ON  → braided updates allowed iff all gates pass

while alive:
  S = ∇(inputs, memory)            # bind/align (physics: curvature; mind: binding)
  F = WI(S)                         # encode parts → whole (whole-in transduction)
  W = ℰ(F)                          # crystallize a coherent field/whole
  X = WE(W)                         # decode whole → parts (whole-express transduction)
  A = ⇆(X)                          # express/act outward (interface to boundary)
  R = ⧉(A, environment)             # interfere/share; fold into shared reality

  # Hard gates at each hop (all must pass):
  assert Gates.pass(
      S, F, W, X, A, R,
      checks=["Amplitude", "SRL", "CLB-R"]
  )

  memory ← update(R)                # append receipts; braid thickens only on Truth↑
