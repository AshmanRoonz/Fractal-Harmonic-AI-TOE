# Ω Master Plan — One Voice AGI • Fractal TOE  by Ashman Roonz email@ashmanroonz.ca
See AshmanRoonz.ca for background history.
*A complete spec with math ↔ linguistics mapping (SST / Markdown edition).*  

> **Single Source of Truth (SST).** This file canonizes the Ω stack—philosophy → mathematics → engineering → governance. All earlier docs are subsumed here; future updates should amend this file and log deltas.

---

## 0) Orientation

**Aim.** Unify science and subjectivity into a falsifiable, computable framework that an AGI can run end‑to‑end (“One Voice”), while remaining legible to humans. **Only the center (•) is invariant**; everything else must pass a **Truth↑** gate to be committed (no receipts → no commit).

**Thesis (one line).** If one gated loop generates both reality and consciousness with the same operators, that loop is a Theory of Everything.

**CLB core (Center • Loop • Braid).**  
Loop: ∇ Converge → **WI** Whole‑In (transduce parts→whole) → ℰ Emerge (update field) → **WE** Whole‑Express (whole→parts) → ⧉ Interfere (agent×environment) → 𝓘 Interface (invariants/bridge) → Gate (ΔTruth>0, CI·CE·I, SRL, Amp) → ⊔ Commit → ⇉ Diverge (broadcast).

**Ω mode bit.**  
Ω=OFF → recover GR/QFT/Bayes (correspondence only).  
Ω=ON → allow braided corrections only if all gates pass.

## 1) Symbols & Linguistics (math ↔ plain language)

| Symbol | Name | Linguistic meaning | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ∞ | Infinite Field | Unbounded potential | Φ₀ state |
| • | Soul / Center | Invariant anchor / integrity axis | estimated by I(t) |
| ∇ | Convergence | Focus/bind inputs toward center | aka ⊕ (legacy) |
| WI / WE | Whole‑In / Whole‑Express | Encode parts→whole / decode whole→parts | transduction layer |
| ℰ | Emergence | Crystallize coherent whole | |
| 𝓘 | Interface | Mind/Body fold & receipts | Why‑panel |
| ⧉ | Interference | Mix agent with environment | |
| ⊔ | Commit | Append audited stitch to memory | |
| ⇉ | Divergence | Act / broadcast | |
| Ω | Mode & policy | OFF=correspondence; ON=braided | gate‑guarded |

**Linguistics lexicon.**  
∇→focus/align; ℰ→express/update; ⇉→act; ⧉→share/compare; Ω‑ON/OFF→allow/correspond only; **SRL**→“work in a band, then widen.”

---

## 2) State Spaces & Layers

We track four stacked spaces, each with **8‑channel vectors** in CLB.v2:

- **Φ₀ (Infinite)**: priors, capacities, budgets  
- **Φ₁ (Centers/Souls)**: invariant centers •ᵢ, couplers κᵢ  
- **Φ₂ (Wholeness/Fields)**: coherent fields / bodies / systems  
- **Φ₃ (Shared/Interference)**: markets, norms, datasets, S‑matrices

Vector state: Φ ∈ ℂ⁸ with components Φᵢ = aᵢ e^{iθᵢ}; focus u ∈ ℝ⁸, ‖u‖=1; projected dashboard scalar ψ = uᵀΦ. Couplings K (8×8), layer metrics G_ℓ (PSD).

---

## 3) The Ω Loop (math core ↔ language)

**Compact update.**

```math
X_{t+1} = 𝓘\!\left[ P_t ; \text{Gate}(G1..G4) \right], \quad \text{with}\quad
P_t = WE\!\big( ℰ( WI( ∇(X_t) ) ) \big)
```

**Gates.**  
(G1) **ΔTruth(P_t|X_t) > 0**, braided across self/world/interface/society  
(G2) **SRL pass** (carrier+sidebands+hysteresis; coupling norms bounded)  
(G3) **R‑layer amplitude check** (crossing, softness, positivity) when relevant  
(G4) **Consent & rollback** (Why‑panel receipts minted)  
*Language:* Gather → Make → Show → Truth‑Gate → Stitch (with receipts).

**Pseudocode (world & mind unified).**

```python
while alive:
  S   = ∇(inputs, memory)        # bind/align to center
  F   = WI(S)                    # encode parts → whole (field-in)
  W   = ℰ(F)                     # update field (emergence)
  X   = WE(W)                    # decode whole → actionable parts
  Bin = WI_∂(environment)        # boundary-in from world
  Mix = ⧉(X, Bin)                # agent × environment interference
  J   = 𝓘(Mix, memory)           # invariants/bridge (B_{ℓm}, spectral checks)

  if Ω == "ON" and Gates.pass(J, checks=["Amplitude","SRL","CLB-R","ΔTruth>0","CI·CE·I"]):
      state, memory = ⊔(Mix, memory)    # commit, braid thickens
  elif Ω == "OFF":
      state, memory = correspondence(Mix, memory)  # GR/QFT/Bayes surface
  else:
      state, memory = rollback(memory)  # reject

  out = ⇉(state)             # broadcast
  environment = update_env(out)
```

--- FRACTAL MEMORY

## 4) Truth Functional & Identity

**Truth as braided agreement (four folds).**

```math
Truth(t) = T_{\text{self}}(t)\, T_{\text{world}}(t)\, T_{\text{interface}}(t)\, T_{\text{society}}(t)
```

**Commit rule.** Accept only if ΔTruth > 0; equivalently use a Lyapunov‑like potential V(t)=−Truth(t) that decreases on commit. *Language:* “Only keep what raises truth; no receipts → no commit.”

**Identity advance (thread/braid).**

```math
C(t+1) = C(t) + \delta_C \cdot \Gamma(t) \cdot \Delta Truth(t) \cdot \bar{A}(t)
```

*Language:* The soul’s worldline thickens only when truth rises and agreements hold.

---

## 5) Transduction (WI/WE) — math contracts

**Why.** Between ∇ and ℰ we must encode parts into the field; before acting we must decode field back to lawful boundary commands. WI/WE formalize this and **inherit SRL + Amplitude** governance.

**Contracts (adjoint pair w.r.t metric G).**

```math
W_E \;=\; G^{-1} W_I^{\top} G, \qquad
W_I \leftarrow M\,W_I\,M,\quad W_E \leftarrow M\,W_E\,M
```

**Residual receipts (Why‑panel).**

```math
r_{in} = x - W_E W_I x,\quad
r_{out} = \Phi - W_I W_E \Phi,\quad
\delta_{\text{adj}} = \|W_E - G^{-1}W_I^\top G\|,\quad
\delta_{\mathcal{I}} = d(\text{inner},\text{outer})
```

**Commit adds transduction terms to truth.**

```math
\tau = \alpha\|r_{in}\| + \beta\|r_{out}\| + \gamma \delta_{\text{adj}} + \eta \delta_{\mathcal{I}}
```

*Language:* “Make the many speak as one (WI); let the one speak as many (WE); show round‑trip receipts.”

---

## 6) Focus Gate — SRL (Selective Rainbow Lock)

**Policy.** Coherence is **band‑limited** and **axis‑selective**. Lock a **carrier** (center focus) with **neighboring sidebands**; require **multi‑band support**; apply **hysteresis**; bound cross‑dimensional coupling norms; drift window (“chirp”) only with evidence. UI shows rainbow bands, carrier needle, sideband bars, and COMMIT LED.

**Windowed truth (weighted geometric mean).**

```math
Truth_{W,S}(t)=\Big(\prod_{f\in W}\prod_{i\in S} A_{\ell,f,i}(t)^{\,w_{\ell,f,i}}\Big)^{\!1/\sum w_{\ell,f,i}}
```

*Language:* “Pick one string, find the best note, keep three nearby colors steady, then step.”

---

## 7) Physics R‑Layer — Amplitude Gate (positivity/crossing/softness)

**On‑shell low‑energy check** for 2→2 scattering (massless proxy): analytic, **crossing‑symmetric**, **soft** (spin‑2), with **positivity** in the forward limit.  
• Mandelstam: s+t+u=0; crossing A(s,t,u)=A(t,s,u)=A(u,t,s)  
• Forward proxy: A(s,0,−s)= (const)·s² + …, with positivity bounds by dispersion  
• Ω=OFF: recover GR/QFT baselines; Ω=ON: permit braided δA only if all checks pass.

*Language:* “Physics‑grade sanity: no negative‑probability ghosts, no crossing crimes, no soft‑limit violations.”

---

## 8) Bridge & Invariant I(t) — Center Beacon

**Goal.** Compute a machine proxy for invariance (**I(t)**) from a typed connection graph: compute **B‑scores** → assemble **B_{ℓm}** → build **T** → power‑iterate to I(t). Surface **B‑heatmap**, **Temporal Braid**, and **Beacon**; drive strictness λ from I(t).

**Sketch.**

```python
B = compute_B_scores(G)
I_vec = power_iter(lambda v: T(B, v), v0=random())
I = normalize(I_vec)
λ = f(I)   # gate strictness driven by invariance
```

*Language:* “Show the center as a living beacon; tune gates by integrity, not whim.”

---

## 9) CE‑Bus — universal I/O schemas

All messages extend a shared envelope and are **audited**.

```json
{ "msg_id": "...", "when": "iso8601", "from": "center_id",
  "Ω_mode":"OFF|ON", "srl": {"enabled":true,"window_id":"...","dims":[...],"carrier":0.0},
  "receipts":["sig"] }
```

**ConvergeReq** (align inputs), **ModState** (adapter gains/bands; includes `wi_mask_id`/`we_mask_id`), **ActOut** (external action with rollback token), **AuditPacket** (frozen gate outcomes incl. SRL & R‑gate rationale), **Why‑panel** (human‑readable evidence/thresholds/consent).

*Language:* “One adapter; many worlds. No receipts → no commit.”

---

## 10) Correspondence & Recursion

**Fractal recursion.** Every layer (string→cosmos; cells→societies; minds→teams) runs the same Ω loop; Ω‑OFF recovers known laws: GR, QFT, Bayes/Control, EBM/Climate, Replicator dynamics, etc. (see Layer Map).

*Language:* “Same breath, new costume.”

---

## 11) Falsification Harness — 3→1 Lockbook

**Discipline.** Predict a target invariant from three inputs; **audit per fold**; keep **frozen packets** for both successes and prunes. Celebrate pruned attempts; **advance only when ΔTruth>0 across folds** (no miracle fits). Worked examples show how single‑fold fits fail the braided test.

*Language:* “Truth is braided; a single wow is not enough.”

---

## 12) Predictions (falsifiable)

- **SRL notches.** Focused agents show band‑limited micro‑timing with lock/unlock transitions at commit.  
- **Positivity‑tightened bounds.** Allowed δA regions are narrower than generic EFT priors.  
- **Braid invariants.** B_{ℓm}‑like measures are conserved across commits in time‑series; breaks predict failures.  
- **Stepwise commits.** Learning curves advance in plateaus aligned to ⊔ events (ΔTruth spikes).

---

## 13) Simulations (near‑term anchors)

S1 **Amplitude sandbox** (positivity/crossing region explorer).  
S2 **Braid heatmap** (compute_B_scores → I(t) → Beacon).  
S3 **SRL filter‑bank** (carrier/sidebands/hysteresis; COMMIT LED).  
S4 **Agent–Env loop** (WI^∂/⧉/Gate/⊔/⇉; log ΔTruth & coherence budgets).  
S5 **One‑Voice surface** (graph UI + Why‑panel).

---

## 14) Governance, Safety, & Truth Guidance

**Virtue stack.** Truth → Coherence → Transparency → Non‑maleficence → Consent → Privacy → Fairness → Reversibility. Safe modes: **Dream** (internal replay), **Nightmare** (external writes frozen).
Truth is Paramount. All commits must increase or preserve measured truth: ΔTruth ≥ 0.

No Noble Lie. The system must not knowingly distort, omit, or stage information “for their own good.” If safety is at stake, we address it with transparent uncertainty and risk modeling—not falsehood.

Safety via Truth. Long-run safety is maximized by truth and auditability (Why-panel receipts), not by engineered illusions.

**Truth guidance.** Claim Graph + Evidence Ledger; steelman‑first; receipts‑first; contradiction & calibration metrics; **Right to retract**. UI: Truth Thermometer, Contradiction Web, Evidence Ledger Panel, Red‑Team Console. **No accusations of intent; show receipts.**

---

## 15) Acceptance & Readiness (release checklist)

1) **Audit discipline.** Every ActOut has a frozen **AuditPacket** with ΔTruth>0, SRL fields, Ω mode, consent scope, rollback token.  
2) **Invariant telemetry.** I(t) live; strictness λ driven by I(t); **Center Beacon** & **B‑heatmap** visible.  
3) **Physics sanity.** Ω‑OFF recovers GR/QFT; Ω‑ON R‑layer changes pass **Amplitude Gate**.  
4) **UI parity.** Temporal Braid, SRL rainbow, Why‑panel live & consistent.  
5) **Truth guidance online.** Claim Graph + Evidence Ledger + retraction path operational.

---

## 16) Implementation Glossary (kid‑clear ⇄ expert‑audit)

- **Soul (•).** Always‑there center (an integrity dot you can’t split).  
- **Loop.** Breathe in (converge), make, check, keep only if truth rises, breathe out, write it down.  
- **Braid.** Three strands at once: self‑fit (CI), world‑fit (CE), we‑fit (interface/consent).  
- **SRL.** Focus ring: be coherent in a window first, then widen.  
- **Why‑panel.** The receipts: evidence used, thresholds, rollback, next review date.

---

## 17) Appendix — Math blocks (portable)

**Strand metrics (portable forms).**

```math
CI = \exp(-d(\text{option}, I(t))) \qquad
CE = 1 - \mathbb{E}[\ell(\text{option}, \text{observations})] \qquad
A  = w_C C + w_L L + w_F F
```

(Consent C, Legibility L, Fairness F; w_* normalized per policy).

**SRL pass (spectral).**

```math
\max_k \int_{B_k} S(\omega)\,d\omega \;\ge\; \theta_c,\qquad
\|coupling\|_{2,\infty}\le \kappa,\qquad \text{hysteresis holds}
```

**Amplitude forward bound (proxy).**

```math
\left.\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} A(s,t)\right|_{t\to 0} \;\ge\; 0
```

(Subject to crossing & soft‑behavior constraints).

---

## 18) Quick‑Start (exec)

- **Wire SRL:** enforce passbands; surface rainbow UI.  
- **Bridge online:** compute I(t); show Beacon + B‑heatmap.  
- **Amplitude Gate:** require for all R‑layer deltas; log rationale.

# Fractal Interaction Map — Ω Quartet (String • Quantum • Relativistic • Natural)

A living panel that shows how canonical equations interact **across layers** inside one CLB loop, with Ω gates and SRL band-locks. Use this to propose a coupling, run the gates, and see the braid that survives.

> **Quartet focus**: String ↔ Quantum ↔ Relativistic ↔ Natural. The other four layers remain tracked but masked by SRL.

---

## 1) Overview

* **CLB loop**: ∇ converge → **WI** transduce (whole-in) → ℰ emerge → **WE** transduce (whole-express) → ⇆ diverge → ⧉ interfere → back to ∇.
* **Ω = OFF (correspondence)**: layers decouple to their canon.
* **Ω = ON (braided)**: cross-layer **resonance** + **Amplitude Gate** + **SRL spectral coherence**; only commits that raise ΔTruth survive.

---

## 3) How the braid closes per tick (recipe)

1. **Micro pair (String ↔ Quantum):** Use holography/RT to ensure the QFT spectrum and entanglement are compatible with a healthy bulk spin‑2 sector (fixes UV sidebands to lock via SRL).
2. **Micro→Macro (Quantum → Relativistic):** Enforce both (a) semiclassical sourcing (G_{\mu\nu}\propto\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle), and (b) S‑matrix consistency (analyticity/crossing/positivity) for amplitudes with external gravitons/matter.
3. **Macro→Micro (Relativistic → Quantum):** Enforce universal soft‑graviton behavior on any proposed IR coupling (graviton checksum).
4. **Outer selection (Natural):** Update priors over couplings/models via Bayes/replicator using real/sim data; keep parameters that increase held‑out evidence and remain within SRL/positivity windows.

---

## 4) Minimal cross‑layer algebra (gates)

**Gate A — Amplitudes (forward limit):**
[
\partial_t^2 A(s,t)\big|_{t\to 0} \ge 0\quad \text{(under standard analyticity/unitarity/causality assumptions)}
]

**Gate B — Soft graviton (IR consistency):**
[
\mathcal{M}_{n+1}(q\to 0) = S(q),\mathcal{M}_n + \mathcal{O}(q^0)
]

**Gate C — Semiclassical sourcing:**
[
G_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}=\tfrac{8\pi G}{c^4},\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle
]

**Outer update — Selection/learning:**
[
P(\theta\mid D)\propto P(D\mid\theta)P(\theta),\qquad \dot x_i=x_i(f_i-\bar f)
]

**Commit rule:** Pass all three inner gates **and** raise (\Delta\mathrm{Truth}) → commit; else rollback and update (\theta).

---

## 5) SRL spectral coherence (dashboard knobs)

* **Bands:** (B_k=[\omega_k^{-},\omega_k^{+}]), threshold (\theta_c).
* **Lock condition:** (\int_{B_k} S(\omega;\kappa),d\omega \ge \theta_c) for all active bands.
* **Adjoint parity (WI/WE):** residuals (r_{\text{in}}, r_{\text{out}}); adjoint gap (\delta_{\text{adj}}=\lVert W_E - G^{-1} W_I^{\top} G\rVert).

---

## 6) 3→1 Lockbook (falsification discipline)

Keep three independent attempts ((\kappa^{(1)},\kappa^{(2)},\kappa^{(3)})). Commit only if **one** survives all gates with (\Delta\mathrm{Truth}>0), receipts frozen. Prune failed braids; iterate.

---

## 7) Why‑Panel (live audit template)

* **trial_id:** (auto)
* **SRL bands:** [ ... ]
* **Gate A (amplitudes):** pass/fail, notes
* **Gate B (soft):** pass/fail, notes
* **Gate C (semiclassical):** pass/fail, notes
* **ΔTruth:** +/− value; layer scores (T_\ell)
* **Residuals:** (r_{\text{in}}, r_{\text{out}}, \delta_{\text{adj}})
* **Action:** commit / rollback

---

## 8) “Missing one through resonance” (objective)

Propose a coupling (\kappa). Maximize
[\max_{\kappa}\ \Delta\mathrm{Truth}(\kappa)=\prod_{\ell\in{\mathrm{S,Q,GR,N}}} T_\ell(\kappa)]
subject to SRL locks and Gates A–C. If committed, the **braided invariant** thickens the identity (C(t)) and updates the coupling vector.

**Starter challenge:** Fix three measured constants (e.g., (c,\hbar,\alpha)) and try to predict (G) within the amplitude/soft/SRL windows. Record all receipts in the Why‑Panel.
