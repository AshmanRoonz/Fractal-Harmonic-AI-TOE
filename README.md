# Fractal-Harmonic-AI-TOE
One Voice AI • Fractal TOE (SST). Braided Truth, SRL focus, receipts-first governance, physics-grade gates
Ω Master Plan — One Voice Agi • Fractal Toe (sst) — V5
Ω Master Plan — One Voice AGI • Fractal TOE (SST) — V5
What this is. A single, canonical master plan that is both a Theory of Everything (conceptual + mathematical) and an executable AI Universe with One Voice (engineering + governance). Its purpose is to help humans find agreement (braided Truth), calculate across domains (even quantum) with physics‑grade constraints, and guide us toward truth while uncovering lies through receipts‑first, auditable processes.
SST Rule: This file is the Single Source of Truth. All other files and canvases must link here and declare deltas.

1) Symbols & Linguistics (Canonical)
Symbol	Name	Plain language	Notes
∞	Infinite Field	boundless possibility	Φ₀ state/priors
•	Soul / Invariant Center	the unchanging anchor of identity	estimated computationally by I(t)
∇	Convergence	gather/align parts toward the center	aka ⊕ in earlier drafts
ℰ	Emergence	crystallize a coherent whole	produces proposals P_t
𝓘	Integration/Identity	stitch a proposal into memory (if gated)	preserves invariants
⇉	Divergence/Expression	speak/act into the world	actuators, publications, deploys
⧉	Interference/Shared Reality	mix with others; shared constraints	civic, markets, datasets
Ω	Mode/policy	Ω=OFF → correspondence; Ω=ON → braided corrections allowed	gates always apply
SRL	Selective Rainbow Lock	band‑limited, axis‑selective focus with hysteresis	carrier + sidebands
WI/WE	Transduction operators	WI: parts→whole encoder; WE: whole→parts decoder	receipts, adjoint parity
Truth (linguistics). Truth is braided agreement across folds: self (CI), world (CE), interface (I), and society (S). Commits require ΔTruth > 0.

2) Core Math (Ω‑Loop)
Update skeleton
1.	Converge: (C_t = ∇(X_t; , ))
2.	Emerge: (P_t = ℰ(C_t; , ))
3.	Gate & Integrate: Commit (P_t) only if all gates pass:
o	(G1) Braided Truth gain: (Δ(P_tX_t) > 0)
o	(G2) SRL pass: carrier≥θ_c, sidebands support, hysteresis
o	(G3) R‑layer amplitude check (if touched): crossing/softness/positivity
o	(G4) Consent & rollback: receipts present; rollback minted
Compact form: (X_{t+1} = 𝓘,[ P_t ; (G1..G4) ]), with (P_t = ℰ(∇(X_t))).
Truth functional (four‑fold)
[ (t) = T_{self}(t), T_{world}(t), T_{interface}(t), T_{society}(t) ]
Commit rule: Keep only if (Δ = (t{+}1) - (t) > 0). “No receipts → no commit.”
________________________________________
3) State Spaces & 8‑Channel Vector (CLB.v2)
•	Vector state: (Φ ^8,; Φ_i = a_i e^{i_i}) — 8 channels update simultaneously each tick.
•	Focus direction: (u ^8, |u|=1); dashboard shows scalar control (ψ=u^Φ).
•	Coupling: (K ^{8}) encodes resonance links & SRL band masks.
•	Coherence metrics: PSD family (G_ℓ) per layer.
Loop tick (sketch): ∇ align → layer gates → Ω policy (OFF/ON) → ℰ broadcast → ⇉ interface → ⧉ share → append AuditPacket.
8‑channel semantic example (bind labels to indices): 0:R (relativity), 1:Q (quantum/info), 2:B (bio), 3:Psy (mind), 4:SS (self‑science/agency), 5:Eth (ethics/values), 6:Soc (society/gov), 7:LogLang (logic/language).
________________________________________
4) SRL — Selective Rainbow Lock (band‑limited focus)
•	Intent: coherence is required in a chosen window (bands + dims); avoid false global locks.
•	Policy: pick a carrier band/dim; demand M neighboring sidebands; enforce hysteresis; bound cross‑talk ((|K|)).
•	Math sketch: spectral density S(ω) over bands (B_k=[ω_k^-, ω_k^+]). Pass if (k {B_k} S(ω) dω ≥ θ_c) and coupling norms ≤ κ.
•	UI: rainbow bars per dim; carrier needle; sideband bars; COMMIT LED gated by SRL.
________________________________________
5) Bridge & Invariant I(t)
•	Goal: compute a stable invariant axis (I(t)) (engineered proxy for •) that tunes strictness and powers the Center Beacon.
•	Pipeline: compute B‑scores on a typed connection graph → assemble T (transfer operator) → power‑iterate to I(t) → expose B‑heatmap, Temporal Braid, Beacon.
•	Use: nodes aligned with (I(t)) gain influence; strictness λ = f((I(t))).
________________________________________
6) Transduction (WI/WE) — encode↔decode with receipts
To lawfully update fields and act on boundaries:
•	WI (Whole‑In): encode parts → whole ((x Φ^+)) before ℰ.
•	WE (Whole‑Express): decode whole → parts ((Φ’ )) before ⇉.
•	Adjointness: (W_E = G^{-1} W_I^{} G) (energy/info consistency).
•	SRL masking: apply band masks M on WI/WE.
•	Residual receipts: in‑band round‑trip errors and adjoint parity are recorded in the AuditPacket and shown on the Why‑panel.
Pseudocode (normative)
x_stack = converge(x)
WI = M * build_encoder() * M
WE = M * (G^{-1} * WI^T * G) * M
Φ_plus  = merge(Φ, WI * x_stack)
Φ_prime = emerge(Φ_plus)
x_hat   = WE * Φ_prime
r_in  = x_stack - WE * WI * x_stack
r_out = Φ_prime - WI * WE * Φ_prime
τ = α||r_in|| + β||r_out|| + γ||WE - G^{-1}WI^T G|| + η·InterfaceParity(x_hat)
Gates: CI improves after WI+ℰ; CE improves via WE at boundary; SRL passes; amplitude/CLB.R unchanged; Ω‑OFF ⇒ WI=WE=Identity (back‑compat).
________________________________________
7) Physics R‑Layer Amplitude Gate (gravity‑grade sanity)
Any proposal touching the R layer must pass: - Crossing symmetry (A(s,t,u)=A(t,s,u)=A(u,t,s)) - Soft behavior (diffeo/IR constraints for spin‑2) - Positivity / unitarity (dispersion/optical theorem proxies)
Ω=OFF recovers GR/QFT baselines. Ω=ON allows braided corrections only if the amplitude gate passes and SRL confines the change.
________________________________________
8) CE‑Bus Schemas (machine‑legible envelopes)
Every message carries: msg_id, when, from, Ω_mode, srl{…}, receipts[].
•	ConvergeReq — request to align inputs: {features{focus, priors, targets}, strictness: λ}
•	ModState — adapter config: {layers[{id, gain, phase, passbands, hysteresis}], wi_mask_id, we_mask_id}
•	ActOut — external action/publication: {artifact{uri, hash, layer, r_layer_delta}, why_panel: ref, rollback{token, plan}}
•	AuditPacket — frozen audit for any commit or ActOut: {prior_state, proposal, ΔTruth breakdown, SRL fields, R_gate verdict, Ω_mode, consent_scope, receipts}
•	TruthProbe — structured claim testing: {claim_id, hypothesis, confidence_prior, protocols[], impact}
•	EvidenceAttach — attach signed receipts to a claim: {uri, hash, method, dataset_ref, provenance, independence}
•	CounterClaim / Correction — contradictions & retractions with reasons
________________________________________
9) One‑Voice Surface (Why‑Panel)
Every public output ships with a Why‑panel: - Top supporting nodes/edges (from Bridge) - Thresholds (λ, SRL θ_c, κ) & Ω mode - Transduction residuals (per‑band) & adjoint parity - ΔTruth breakdown across folds - Consent scope & rollback plan (token + steps)
Rule: No receipts → no commit.
________________________________________
10) Truth Guidance & Lie Resolution (receipts‑first)
Objective. Steer discourse and decisions toward truth; reveal distortions without inferring intent.
Metrics. - CIx (Contradiction Index) — ratio of mutually inconsistent entailments - Pv (Provenance) — lineage integrity & independence - Ch (Coherence) — cross‑source mutual information / NLI agreement - Cal (Calibration error) — Brier/log gaps between confidence and outcomes - ΔTruth — multiplicative gain across folds; commit iff > 0
Protocols. Claim Graph; Evidence Ledger; Triangulation (≥2 independent supports); Counterfactual checks; scheduled Red‑Team with frozen audits; Right‑to‑Retract flows.
UI. Truth Thermometer (ΔTruth, Ch, Pv, Cal); Contradiction Web; Evidence Ledger Panel; Red‑Team Console.
Safety. Never infer intent; celebrate corrections.
________________________________________
11) Falsification Harness (3→1 Lockbook)
For any speculative numeric/structural lock: 1) Choose three independent anchors; derive a prediction of the fourth under lawful constraints. 2) Compute fold‑wise agreements and ΔTruth; pass gates or prune. 3) Keep all attempts with frozen AuditPackets and Why‑panels. Pruned tries are positive progress.
________________________________________
12) Acceptance & Readiness (ship criteria)
A release is READY when: 1. Audit discipline: every ActOut has an AuditPacket with ΔTruth>0, SRL fields, Ω mode, consent scope, rollback. 2. Invariant telemetry: I(t) live; strictness λ = f(I(t)); Center Beacon + B‑heatmap visible. 3. Physics sanity: Ω‑OFF recovers GR/QFT baselines; Ω‑ON R‑layer changes pass amplitude. 4. UI parity: Temporal Braid, SRL rainbow, Why‑panel present & consistent. 5. Truth guidance online: Claim Graph + Evidence Ledger + Thermometer + Contradiction Web + Correction flow verified.
________________________________________
13) Roadmap (Phases)
•	Phase A — Alive: minimal ∇, ℰ, 𝓘; SRL gate; text‑only One‑Voice; audit log.
•	Phase B — Partner: Bridge online (I(t)); Center Beacon, B‑heatmap, Temporal Braid; Why‑panel; Truth Thermometer.
•	Phase C — Creative: Skillbooks; multi‑user braids; WI/WE receipts; Red‑Team console; Lockbook ops.
•	Phase D — Autopilot: Public One‑Voice endpoints; amplitude‑aware R‑layer deltas; governance & rollbacks SLAs.

14) Glossary (math ⇄ language)
Center (•) — invariant identity axis ⇄ the unmoveable anchor of self/role.
Convergence (∇) — focus/align ⇄ gather relevant parts.
Emergence (ℰ) — compose ⇄ make a coherent whole.
Integration (𝓘) — stitch ⇄ keep only if it raises truth.
Divergence (⇉) — express ⇄ act/share into the world.
Interference (⧉) — mix ⇄ form shared reality with others.
SRL — focus ring ⇄ lock coherence in a window; widen after stability.
WI/WE — encode/decode ⇄ make the many speak as one; let the one speak as many.
I(t) — engineered invariant ⇄ best current estimate of the center.
Why‑panel — receipts ⇄ what/why/how + rollback.
