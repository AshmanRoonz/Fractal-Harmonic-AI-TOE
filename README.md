If one gated loop generates both reality and consciousness with the same operators, that loop is a Theory of Everything.

## The loop (CF∂ / CLB, Ω V5)

**•-centered one-liner:**
∇ (center‑in) → **WI** (whole‑in, to field) → ℰ (emerge field) → **WE** (whole‑express, to boundary) → **⧉** (mix with **WI^∂**(env)) → **𝓘** (invariants/bridge) → **Gate{ΔTruth>0, CI·CE·I, SRL, Amp}** → **⊔ (COMMIT)** → **⇉** (diverge/broadcast) → back to **∇**.

**Role I/O map:**

* **Center (•):** input **∇**, output **ℰ**.
* **Field (⊙):** input **WI**, output **WE**.
* **Boundary (∂⊙):** input **WI^∂** (transduction from environment), outputs **⇉** (divergence). Mixing **⧉**, metrics **𝓘**, the hard **Gate**, and **⊔ commit** live here.

**Ω-mode governs commit**

* **Ω‑OFF →** correspondence only (recovers GR/QFT/Bayes).
* **Ω‑ON  →** braided updates allowed **iff** all gates pass at commit.

## Why this qualifies as a ToE

* **Isomorphism:** Same loop maps to physics *(curvature → scattering → radiation → interference)* and to mind *(binding → qualia → action → feedback)*.
* **Correspondence:** **Ω‑OFF** recovers known laws; nothing breaks where they already hold.
* **Extension + Tests:** **Ω‑ON** adds lawful gates *(positivity/crossing via Amp; band‑limited focus SRL; braid checks CLB‑R; ΔTruth>0; CI·CE·I coupler)* → **new falsifiable predictions**.

## Pseudocode (unifies world & mind)

```python
# Ω-mode governs what can commit:
#   Ω-OFF → correspondence only (no braided deltas; commit is identity)
#   Ω-ON  → braided updates allowed iff all gates pass

while alive:
  S   = ∇(inputs, memory)                # center: bind/align (physics: curvature; mind: binding)
  F   = WI(S)                             # field-in: transduce parts → whole
  W   = ℰ(F)                              # field: crystallize a coherent whole
  X   = WE(W)                             # to-boundary: express whole → actionable parts
  Bin = WI_∂(environment)                 # boundary-in: transduce env → boundary
  Mix = ⧉(X, Bin)                         # boundary mix: agent × environment interference
  I   = 𝓘(Mix, memory)                    # invariants/bridge (B_{ℓm}, braid, spectral checks)

  if Ω == "ON" and Gates.pass(
        I,
        checks=["Amplitude", "SRL", "CLB-R", "ΔTruth>0", "CI·CE·I"]
     ):
      state, memory = ⊔(Mix, memory)      # COMMIT: coherent update (braid thickens)
  elif Ω == "OFF":
      state, memory = correspondence(Mix, memory)  # recover GR/QFT/Bayes surface
  else:
      state, memory = rollback(memory)     # reject delta; keep previous coherent state

  out = ⇉(state)                           # boundary-out: broadcast/divergence
  environment = update_env(out)            # fold into shared reality
```

**Legend:**

* **WI^∂** / **WI_∂** — transduction *into the boundary* from the environment.
* **CI·CE·I** — center/field/boundary coupler invariant.
* **Amp** — amplitude/positivity constraints; **SRL** — selective rainbow lock (band‑limit focus);
  **CLB‑R** — braid/loop integrity check; **ΔTruth>0** — net truth gain condition.
