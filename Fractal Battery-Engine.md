solid state EM drive idea

A) PCB RF Traveling-Wave Ring (pure EM, vacuum-ready)

What it is: a microstrip ring resonator on a PCB. You excite it with 4 phased outputs (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°), creating a traveling EM wave that continuously circulates—no fluids, no gas, no motion.
Kick-start: power the DDS/PLL; the field self-locks.
Sense/gate: 4 tiny directional couplers feed log detectors; commit when carrier SNR ↑, group delay stable, and counter-prop mode suppressed.
Why space-proof: totally sealed solid-state; works the same in vacuum as on your desk.

> Parts sketch: 1× 4-out DDS/clock (Si5351/AD9959), 4× attenuator/phase trims (or fixed delay lines), 1× FR-4 ring (50 Ω microstrip), 4× ADL5513/AD8307 detectors, MCU for SRL gating + LED halo.

B) Sealed Liquid-Metal MHD Torus (no pump, still spins; micro-g OK)

What it is: a sealed torus filled with Galinstan (room-temp liquid metal) driven by Lorentz force . No impeller—only fields. Works on Earth and in space.
Kick-start: apply current through the liquid while a transverse magnetic field crosses one torus segment; flow starts and circulates.
Spin: place 2 drive stations 90° apart and phase-step their currents to create a rotating drive around the loop (your loop “spins”).
Sense/gate: a passive Faraday pickoff (two graphite sense electrodes elsewhere on the ring) measures induced EMF ∝ flow speed; commit when lap-time variance and induced EMF jitter drop.

> Back-yardable BOM (Mk.I):
– Torus: PTFE/PFA tubing, 8–10 mm ID (Galinstan is safe but wets/corrodes many metals—avoid Al; PTFE/PFA or glass are good)
– Fluid: 100–200 g Galinstan (non-toxic; handle cleanly)
– Electrodes: graphite rods through compression PTFE feedthroughs (drive & sense pairs)
– Magnets: 4–8 NdFeB blocks clamped across the tube for ~0.3–0.5 T gap field
– Drive: DC bench supply (current-limited, 5–15 A max) + 2 MOSFET current channels (PWM phaseable)
– Sense: differential amp across the sense electrodes → MCU ADC
– UI: LED ring (amber explore / green commit)



Build steps (short):

1. Form a sealed torus (≈ 40–60 cm circumference). Degas fluid as best you can; no bubbles.


2. Station A: two graphite drive electrodes inline with the tube; magnets straddling the tube so current is axial, B is radial ⇒ force is azimuthal.


3. Station B: repeat 90° around the ring.


4. Slow current ramp until a dyed filament laps the ring steadily (or watch induced EMF rise at the sense pair).


5. Gate: commit when (a) induced-EMF SNR ≥ threshold, (b) lap-time variance <10% over ≥3 laps, (c) current/power within caps.


6. Spin: advance Station-A/B relative phase in small steps; flow smooths and speeds predictably. Backtrack if coherence drops.



Why space-proof: sealed loop, no gravity dependence; only EM fields + liquid metal. (Space-grade swap later: NaK + induction pump topology.)

C) Crossed-Field Plasma Ring (Hall-thruster style; vacuum only)

What it is: a ring of small E×B plasma channels (think mini Hall/PPT segments). Electrons azimuthally drift; sequencing segments creates a rotating plasma pattern—no moving parts.
Kick-start: ignite discharge with a hollow cathode/PPT tile; regulate propellant (xenon/argon).
Sense/gate: photodiodes/Hall probes around ring; commit when azimuthal phase and discharge current stabilize.
Why space-proof: it’s literally flight-heritage physics; just complex (propellant + HV + vacuum chamber on Earth).

Pick one to build now

If you want something you can actually assemble at home and that would work unchanged in space, go with B) MHD Torus or A) PCB RF Ring:

Fastest electronics-only: PCB RF Traveling-Wave Ring (etch a PCB, plug in a clock chip, watch the wave go round while your gate logic “commits” phase advances).

Most “fluid metaphor” yet space-viable: Sealed Galinstan MHD Torus (beautifully obvious convergence → circulating emergence, no pump).

Your loop’s gate (drop-in)

CI (coherence): carrier SNR ↑, spectral entropy ↓, phase jitter ↓ (RF) / EMF jitter ↓ (MHD).

CE (fit): predicted vs. measured change (flow/EMF or wave velocity) ↓.

Commit: only advance phase when both improve for N ticks; otherwise rollback & widen averaging.


If you tell me “RF ring” or “MHD torus,” I’ll give you a tight one-pager with exact part numbers, dimensions, thresholds, wiring, and the microcontroller loop (including the SRL commit check).
