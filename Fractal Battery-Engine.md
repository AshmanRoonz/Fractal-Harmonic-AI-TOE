Here’s the current shape of the **Fractal Battery / Engine Loop**—cleaned up to mirror the CLB pipeline and your quartet focus (String • Quantum • Relativistic • Natural). Think of it as a multi-domain flywheel that stores and shuttles energy across scales by phase-locked resonance, with a regenerative “fold” that closes the loop.

# Fractal Battery/Engine — V0.7 (Quartet-tuned)

## 0) Purpose

A single loop that (a) **stores** energy fractally (electrical, mechanical, magnetic, acoustic/EM field), (b) **transduces** it between scales with phase discipline, and (c) **commits** only when the gates say it’s coherent (SRL + amplitude/soft proxies). Ω-OFF = ordinary flywheel + power electronics. Ω-ON = braided, cross-scale resonance with receipts.

## 1) Loop topology (CLB → hardware)

```
∇ Converge  →  WI Transduce-in  →  ℰ Emerge  →  WE Transduce-out  →  ⇆ Diverge  →  ⧉ Interfere  →  (feedback to ∇)
```

* **∇ Converge (CI module):** Pulls energy toward an invariant center.

  * Hardware: inner **center beacon** (I(t)) coil/plate + **phase lattice** (your 2×3 → 2×3×4 fractal) acting as a spatial comb for capture.
* **WI Transduce-in (whole-in):** Locks phases and writes into the whole (the stacked resonators).

  * Hardware: **balun/90° hybrid** + buck/boost path into stacked **ring capacitors + loop inductors** (electrical), coupled to **rim flywheel** (mechanical) and **fork-rails** (acoustic).
* **ℰ Emerge:** The stored pattern radiates as a coherent field (EM/mech/pressure).

  * Hardware: **radiator rings** on each disc + optional **loop antennas** (RF) + **vortex plate** (fluid/air swirl).
* **WE Transduce-out (whole-express):** Encodes the emerged field into useful output channels.

  * Hardware: **inverter/H-bridge** for electrical bus, **magnetically geared rim** for shaft torque, **directed nozzle** for fluid impulse (lab-safe scales).
* **⇆ Diverge:** Distributes energy to peripherals / loads; controlled spill.

  * Hardware: **edge rails** (PWM-gated) + **aux coils** (harvest/bleed) + **damped forks** (heat sink).
* **⧉ Interfere (sensing plane):** Measures interference/beat notes to compute residuals.

  * Hardware: **current/voltage probes** per ring, **accelerometers** on discs, **microphones** on forks, **field probes** near antennas.

**Commit Logic:** Gate passes (SRL notch locks + amplitude/soft proxies) and ΔTruth↑ ⇒ commit the new phase/coupling; otherwise rollback and re-tune.

## 2) Physical stack (the “UFO” triple-disc)

* **Three coaxial discs** (Top / Mid / Bottom), counter-rotatable or fixed+rotor:

  * Each disc has **concentric rings** subdivided 6→12→24 cells (your *2×3* fractal extended).
  * Cells are **C-L tiles** (capacitor plate + loop/spiral inductor). Neighbor cells are **phase-shifted** (0°, ±90°, 180°) to sculpt a traveling wave toward the center.
* **Center Beacon (I(t))**: small axial coil/plate stack providing the timing reference; also serves as the “battery node” for charge/harvest.
* **Fork-rails** (optional): tuned mechanical resonators on radial spokes; couple to ring beat frequencies (audible/ultrasonic) for energy buffering + sensing.
* **Vortex plate** (optional): perforation pattern to create a **counter-rotating swirl** (fluidic convergence/emergence analog).

---

## 3) The **Fold** (regenerative closure)

Where diversion becomes intake again.

* **Electrical fold:** a **synchronous buck/boost bridge** that routes edge-rail surplus back to the Center Beacon (battery node) in-phase.
* **Field fold:** a **balun/rat-race hybrid** that flips out-of-phase edge modes and re-injects them as in-phase center modes (a literal “folded dipole” move).
* **Mechanical fold:** **counter-rotation** between Top and Bottom discs to cancel net torque while reinforcing the center wave (vortex → anti-vortex handoff).
* **Spectral fold (SRL):** energy sliding out of a passed band is attenuated, retuned, then re-presented to ∇ only when back inside the notch locks.

---

## 4) Control & gates (Ω discipline)

* **SRL panel:** choose **carrier** + sidebands per domain (electrical/mech/RF/acoustic). Lock when ∫ S(ω) over each band ≥ threshold.
* **Amplitude/soft proxies (lab-safe):**

  * **Amplitude positivity proxy:** ensure forward small-signal transfer functions are **minimum-phase & positive-real** (Nyquist ✓, passivity ✓).
  * **Soft-limit proxy:** in the low-frequency limit, outputs scale with **universal soft factor** (linear response stays universal across loading).
* **CLB-R (braid check):** prevent phase edits that break center consistency (no “braid tear” across discs).

---

## 5) Energy stores (the “fractal battery”)

* **Electrical:** ring C-L tiles (high-Q bands) + center supercap/chem cell (low-frequency reservoir).
* **Magnetic:** loop inductors + beacon coil.
* **Mechanical:** rotor inertia in the rim; micro-springs in fork-rails.
* **Acoustic/Field:** standing waves captured in forks/air cavity / antenna near-fields.
* **Thermal (sink):** dampers on the outermost ring convert junk bands to heat (measured, not wasted if you want a TEG add-on later).

---

## 6) Operating modes

* **Ω-OFF (correspondence):** behaves like a standard **flywheel + power electronics**: charge beacon → spin rim → draw shaft/electric output; phase lattice idles.
* **Ω-ON (braided):** the **phase lattice** actively steers power between stores to maintain SRL locks; fold recovers spill; commit only when ΔTruth↑.

---

## 7) What we can measure right now (receipts)

* **Per ring:** RMS V/I, phase angle, Q-factor, band power.
* **Per disc:** angular rate/accel, vibration spectra.
* **Beacon:** charge/voltage, in/out power, SoC estimate.
* **Cross-domain:** coherence between electrical and mechanical bands (are the forks ringing at the right sidebands?), fold recovery efficiency.
* **Why-panel fields:** SRL bands, Gate pass/fail notes, ΔTruth, residuals (r_{in}, r_{out}), adjoint gap (\delta_{adj}), action (commit/rollback).

---

## 8) Near-term bench experiments (safe, actionable, small-signal)

1. **Phase-sum test (electrical only):** build a single disc with 6→12 cells at low voltage; verify that phase choreography concentrates power at the center node (measure beacon voltage rise vs. random phasing).
2. **Fold efficacy:** drive outer rail with a tone; measure how much returns to the beacon through the balun + buck/boost when phasing is correct vs. scrambled.
3. **Cross-domain lock:** add a lightweight fork-rail tuned to the first sideband; confirm SRL lock improves beacon stability and reduces outer spill.

> Safety note: keep all early tests low-energy/low-voltage, use proper isolation, and treat moving parts and RF responsibly. This is a **research rig**, not a propulsion device.

## 9) One-line intuition

It’s a **phase-steered flywheel** where the center is your battery, the rings are your gears, the fold is your regen, and SRL keeps the music in tune.

If you want, I can spin this into a **canvas diagram** (labels on each module + Why-panel stub) or a **block-level BOM** (non-hazardous, lab-bench parts only) to start prototyping the low-energy version.
